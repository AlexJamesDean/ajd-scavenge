> **TL;DR:** AJD Scavenge is the go-to FiveM scavenging script for servers that want cinematic routes, lore-aware loot, and rock-solid server performance.

## Feature Deep Dive

| Pillar | Details |
| --- | --- |

## FAQ

**Does it work with QBCore or ESX?**  
AJD Scavenge is purpose-built for QBCore. Custom frameworks can integrate via exports, but ESX is not supported.

**Can I create multiple scavenging types (trash, salvage, relics)?**  
Absolutely. Each PolyZone polygon can have its own loot pools, cooldowns, rarity multipliers, and visual styles.

**Does it support controller players?**  
Yes. Input prompts are abstracted so you can map them to keyboard, controller, or custom radial menus.

**Will it tank client FPS?**  
No. The LOD manager only spawns high-detail props when players are nearby, and every entity is cleaned server-side.

**Is there an API for my HUD or battle pass?**  
Yes. Exports + events make it easy to display stats, rewards, or streaks wherever you want.
